# Battle Manager

### A Battle Tracker for DND

## Why?
Existing initiative trackers never feel good to use. They always feel less efficient than simple pen and paper. Technology is all about implementing speed and efficiency, so that is what I aim to bring.

## Version Roadmap
### Version 0.1 - Battle Manager w/ Shortcuts
- [x] Initiative Order
- [x] Health Tracking
- [x] AC Display
- [x] Keyboard Shortcuts

### Version 0.1.1 - Key Tweaks
- [x] Ctrl/Shift/Alt+99
- [x] Click then Shift/Alt
- [x] Battle log
- [x] Initiative sorting
- [x] Undo

### Version 0.1.2 - Buttons
- [x] Buttons for damaging, healing, undoing

### Version 0.1.3 - Fixing for the future
- [x] Proper undo, not just undo the last action which also undoes the undo
- [x] Better way of displaying info

### Version 0.1.4 - Better Buttons
- [x] Better button inputs
- [x] Quicker code (slightly)

### Version 0.1.5 - Deleting characters
- [x] Delete button and key for removing selection from initiative  

There has been a lot of sub updates for 0.1. The goal of 0.1 is to achieve a version that is fully usable (although 'undo' may be in excess to the following idea) but not fully featured. Hopefully this will be the last amendment to version 0.1 so that I can work on more convenient features and less tweaks to the base system. 

### Version 0.2 - Friends and Info
- [x] Create Party Set
- [x] ~~Export/Import Party Set~~ _This is implemented through sharing json files_
- [x] Add Party Set to tracker
